          Hi, Iâ€™m Brandon. Currently, I am studying Full-Stack development through a remote development school called Microverse. So far in my career I have utilized various layers of the OSI model through working experience in home internet installation,
          computer repair, virus removal, network management, and satellite communications. I am proud to now consider myself versed in multiple coding languages as well. I have repeatedly achieved distinction in both the military and the private sector for my
          attention to detail and innovative solutions. Finding the answer to any problem has been a driving force in my life and in software development I have found debugging code to be particularly satisfying. I am eager to begin working as a web designer
          and software developer while aspiring towards a senior position with Cisco Systems. So what issue is weighing on you the most at the moment? I would love the opportunity to help you in your next endeavor. Contact me now to discuss what I can do for
          you. Thank you for your time, I look forward to hearing from you!</p>
